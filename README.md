### Max. Eckardt. Himself!

I am co-founder of the [Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus](https://chcaa.io) and worked there until recently.  
Before that I also worked for the [Danish national Interactive HPC center](https://interactivehpc.dk) and previously for [CodeRefinery](https://coderefinery.org)
